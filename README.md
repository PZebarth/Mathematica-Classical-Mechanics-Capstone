# The-Toda-Lattice
Using classical mechanic's theories to prove the integrability of the toda lattice for a repeating unit of 3, the file TheTodaLattice.pdf is the presentation file which explains the procedure, the Toda_Hanna_Paul.nb is the wolfram alpha file we used for the visuals displayed in the presentation, and I included the code in the text file TheTodaLattice incase you don't have this program.
